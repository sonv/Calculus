\begin{problem}[20 points]
A 170-cm-tall person walks toward a wall at a rate of  0.5 m/sec.
A spotlight is located on the ground 10m from the wall.
How fast does the height of the personâ€™s shadow on the wall change when the person is 5 m from the wall?
\end{problem}

\newpage

\begin{problem}[20 points]
Consider the following function
$$ f(x) = \sin x + x^2 $$
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Find the linear approximation $L(x)$ of $f(x)$ around $a = 1$.
	      \vspace{8cm}
	\item Find the Taylor series (to the 3rd power) of the function $f(x)$ around $a = 1$.
	      \vspace{8cm}
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\newpage

\begin{problem}[20 points]
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Sketch the graph of a function $f$ that is continuous on $[1,5]$ that has absolute maximum at 5, absolute minimum at 2,   local maximum at 3, local minima at 2 and 4.
	      \vspace{8cm}
	\item Let $m$ be the number of local minima and  $M$ be the number of local maxima.
	      Can you create a function where  $M > m+ 2$? Draw a graph to support your claim.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\newpage

\begin{problem}[20 points]
Consider a lifeguard at position $A$ at a circular pool with diameter  50m.
He must reach someone who is drowning on the exact opposite side of the pool, at position  $C$.
The lifeguard swims with a speed  $v$ and runs around the pool at speed  $w= 2v$.

\end{figure}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Find a function that measures the total amount of time it takes to reach the drowning person as a function of the swim angle,  $\theta$.
	      \vspace{7cm}
	\item Find at what angle  $\theta$ the lifeguard should swim to reach the drowning person in the least amount of time.
\end{enumerate}
