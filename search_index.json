Main Text: Calculus Vol.1 &amp; Vol. 2, OpenStax Calculus, Vol. 1, Tom Apostol Active Calculus by Schlicker et al.  (https://activecalculus.org/single/book-1.html) Thomas’ Calculus: Early Transcendentals by Hass, Heil, et al. \\(14^{th}\\) edition. Calculus Early Transcendental by Stewart. \\(8^{th}\\) edition. Anything you can find on Google would work. Calculus is a subject that people have written about so much. So, there’s no excuse for not having access to the knowledge. Course description How can we estimate the weight of a bridge? What price should a store set for a product so as to maximize the revenue? Calculus provides tools to answer these questions and many more. Calculus is fundamental to many scientific disciplines including physics, engineering, statistics, computer science, and economics. Using everyday language and graphs, as well as equations, data, and numerical approaches, this course will provide the essential concepts of Calculus, illustrated, and explored through a wide range of real-world examples. Students will develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills, while also gaining a solid preparation for higher-level courses such as differential equations or statistics. The main topics are functions, limits, derivatives, and integrals. Syllabus &amp; Schedule Week 1 (Aug. 19 - Aug. 23): M: General discussion &amp; Review of functions. Read Vol.1, Chapter 1.

Please be respectful to your classmates. Attendance I don’t take attendance. It’s up to you to decide if it’s worth it to go to class. Homework Homework is highly recommended and often required to learn any Math subject. However, I will not collect your homework. As adults, you are responsibile for your own learning. Instead of spending time grading your homework, I decide to increase my office hour time so you have more access to me, should you need it.

Academic Dishonesty As Fulbright University’s Code of Academic Integrity explains: “plagiarism occurs when a writer appropriates another’s ideas, research, or writing without proper acknowledgement of the source or uses another’s words without the use of quotation marks, whether intentional or not.” All Fulbright students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the Code of Academic Integrity. Learning Support Please remember that “Help is always available at FUV, if you just reach out!”. There are ample resources available to help you survive and thrive on your academic journey.
