Main Text: Calculus Vol.1 &amp; Vol. 2, OpenStax Calculus, Vol. 1, Tom Apostol Active Calculus by Schlicker et al.  (https://activecalculus.org/single/book-1.html) Thomas’ Calculus: Early Transcendentals by Hass, Heil, et al. \\(14^{th}\\) edition. Calculus Early Transcendental by Stewart. \\(8^{th}\\) edition. Anything you can find on Google would work. Calculus is a subject that people have written about so much. So, there’s no excuse for not having access to the knowledge. Course description How can we estimate the weight of a bridge? What price should a store set for a product so as to maximize the revenue? Calculus provides tools to answer these questions and many more. Calculus is fundamental to many scientific disciplines including physics, engineering, statistics, computer science, and economics. Using everyday language and graphs, as well as equations, data, and numerical approaches, this course will provide the essential concepts of Calculus, illustrated, and explored through a wide range of real-world examples. Students will develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills, while also gaining a solid preparation for higher-level courses such as differential equations or statistics. The main topics are functions, limits, derivatives, and integrals. Learning objectives Two things: - I hope this course will help you have fun and nerdy conversations with friends (or strangers on the bus), whether they’re math people or not. At the least, if you don’t like the awkward silence, strike a conversation about \\(\\infty\\)! - I hope you will find beauty in mathematics by knowing that mathematics is all about ideas, not computations (although computations play a big part in the usefulness of mathematics). Tentative Syllabus (subject to change) 1. Functions and Limits Functions, graphs, and mathematical modeling Compositions and transformations Limits, asymptotes, and continuity 2. Derivatives Slope of a straight line Concept and definition of the derivative Differentiability Techniques of calculating derivatives Shapes of curves, extrema, and optimization Implicit differentiation Related rates Differentials and small changes Antiderivatives 3. Integrals Sequences and series Concept and definition of the integral The fundamental theorem of calculus Integrals and areas Techniques of calculating integrals Numerical integration Improper integrals Schedule Week 1: M: General discussion &amp; Review of functions. Read Vol.1, Chapter 1. W: Preview of Calculus, Introduction to limits. Read Vol.1, 2.1, 2.2 Week 2: Class Policies (subject to change) Lectures If you must sleep, please don’t snore. (Thanks Gautam Iyer for this amazing policy!) Please be respectful to your classmates. Attendance I don’t take attendance. It’s up to you to decide if it’s worth it to go to class. Quizzes There will be quizzes every day. There will be no make-up quizzes. Three worst quizzes will be dropped, however. Homework Homework must be turned in by the beginning of the class on the due date. All homework must be turned in via paper but you need to submit a scanned version to Canvas for proof of submission. Collaboration for homework is strongly encouraged but you MUST write up your own work. Word-to-word copying is plagiarism. Generously credit all of the people who you collaborate with at the beginning of your work. If you use outside sources (internet, books, friends, etc.) for a particular problem, acknowledge them at the beginning of the problem. You will NOT be penalized for consulting outside sources as long as you credit them. Late homework policy: Late homework will NOT be accpeted. However, the two worst homeworks will be dropped. Advice: Eat well and get enough sleep. Start early. One problem per day is more pleasant than seven problems in one night. Try to understand the materials rather than rote memorization. This will show in exams. Try to write clearly and demonstrate clarity of thoughts. Grading (subject to change) Homework: 30% Daily quizzes: 25% Midterm: 20% Final: 25% Letter Grade Percentage A [93,100] A- [90,93) B+ [87,90) B [83,87) B- [80, 83) C+ [77,80) C [73,77) C- [70,73) D+ [67,70) D [60, 66) F [0,60) Time Expectations On average, you should expect to be roughly 3 hours in class per week, which are included in a total of 10 working hours per course per week. If you are finding it difficult to complete your work in time, please come talk to me ASAP so that we can diagnose the issue and adjust accordingly. If something is not working for you, please do not hesitate to raise it in one of the feedback sessions or come see me outside of class. Academic Dishonesty As Fulbright University’s Code of Academic Integrity explains: “plagiarism occurs when a writer appropriates another’s ideas, research, or writing without proper acknowledgement of the source or uses another’s words without the use of quotation marks, whether intentional or not.” All Fulbright students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the Code of Academic Integrity. Learning Support Please remember that “Help is always available at FUV, if you just reach out!”. There are ample resources available to help you survive and thrive on your academic journey. The Fulbright Learning Support team can provide you with guidance in the following areas: Academic skills (e.g., Reading, Writing, Listening, Speaking and Presentation) Study skills (e.g., Time management, Planning your Assignments, Task Management, Note-taking Skills) Research-related skills (e.g., Selecting Peer-reviewed Journals, Qualitative Coding, Planning a Research Project) Exam strategies &amp; Test-taking skills Academic Integrity (e.g., Avoiding Plagiarism, Paraphrasing Skills, Citing and Referencing) Individual Learning Plan (i.e., Brainstorming, Planning, Prioritizing, Monitoring, Reflection on Learning) Making use of the Work-in-Progress Learning Guides for independently learning fundamental academic skills and study skills Discipline-related content (e.g., Arts, History, Vietnam Studies) Support for these areas includes Workshops, Skill Practice Sessions and Group Advising Sessions organized during the semesters, and you can also refer to the Study Skills &amp; Academic Skills 101 canvas module. Additionally, if you would like to have one-on-one advising/ mentoring sessions to discuss your specific academic concerns (e.g., how to improve your thesis statement, how to ‘polish’ your academic writing style, identify your strengths and weaknesses in your academic reading skills), you can book an appointment with a learning support staff member or with a peer mentor via the booking link.
