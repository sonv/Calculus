\subsection*{Course description}\label{course-description}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Course description}

How can we estimate the weight of a bridge? What price should a store set for a product so as to maximize the revenue? Calculus provides tools to answer these questions and many more. Calculus is fundamental to many scientific disciplines including physics, engineering, statistics, computer science, and economics. Using everyday language and graphs, as well as equations, data, and numerical approaches, this course will provide the essential concepts of Calculus, illustrated, and explored through a wide range of real-world examples. Students will develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills, while also gaining a solid preparation for higher-level courses such as differential equations or statistics. The main topics are functions, limits, derivatives, and integrals.

\subsection*{Learning objectives}\label{learning-objectives}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Learning objectives}

Two things:
- I hope this course will help you have fun and nerdy conversations with friends (or strangers on the bus), whether they're math people or not.
At the least, if you don't like the awkward silence, strike a conversation about \(\infty\)!
- I hope you will find beauty in mathematics by knowing that mathematics is all about ideas,
not computations (although computations play a big part in the usefulness of mathematics).

On average, you should expect to be roughly 3 hours in class per week, which are included in a total of 10 working hours per course per week. If you are finding it difficult to complete your work in time, please come talk to me ASAP so that we can diagnose the issue and adjust accordingly. If something is not working for you, please do not hesitate to raise it in one of the feedback sessions or come see me outside of class.

\subsection*{Academic Dishonesty}\label{academic-dishonesty}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Academic Dishonesty}

As Fulbright University's Code of Academic Integrity explains: ``plagiarism occurs when a writer appropriates another's ideas, research, or writing without proper acknowledgement of the source or uses another's words without the use of quotation marks, whether intentional or not.'' All Fulbright students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the Code of Academic Integrity.

\subsection*{Learning Support}\label{learning-support}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Learning Support}

Please remember that ``Help is always available at FUV, if you just reach out!''. There are ample resources available to help you survive and thrive on your academic journey. The Fulbright Learning Support team can provide you with guidance in the following areas:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Academic skills (e.g., Reading, Writing, Listening, Speaking and Presentation)
\item
  Study skills (e.g., Time management, Planning your Assignments, Task Management, Note-taking Skills)\\
\item
  Research-related skills (e.g., Selecting Peer-reviewed Journals, Qualitative Coding, Planning a Research Project)
\item
  Exam strategies \& Test-taking skills\\
\item
  Academic Integrity (e.g., Avoiding Plagiarism, Paraphrasing Skills, Citing and Referencing)
\item
  Individual Learning Plan (i.e., Brainstorming, Planning, Prioritizing, Monitoring, Reflection on Learning)
\item
  Making use of the Work-in-Progress Learning Guides for independently learning fundamental academic skills and study skills
\item
  Discipline-related content (e.g., Arts, History, Vietnam Studies)
\end{itemize}

Support for these areas includes Workshops, Skill Practice Sessions and Group Advising Sessions organized during the semesters, and you can also refer to the Study Skills \& Academic Skills 101 canvas module. Additionally, if you would like to have one-on-one advising/ mentoring sessions to discuss your specific academic concerns (e.g., how to improve your thesis statement, how to `polish' your academic writing style, identify your strengths and weaknesses in your academic reading skills), you can book an appointment with a learning support staff member or with a peer mentor via the booking link.\\
If you have further questions about learning support, please send an email to \href{mailto:learning.support@fulbright.edu.vn}{\nolinkurl{learning.support@fulbright.edu.vn}}
